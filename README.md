**Building a Beginner's Toolkit for Go**

A beginner-friendly Go project designed to help new developers get started with the Go programming language. This repository contains essential examples and setup instructions for your Go development journey.

## 🚀 Features

- Basic Go program examples
- Step-by-step setup guide
- Beginner-friendly code structure
- Clear documentation and examples

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Internet connection for downloading Go
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, GoLand, or any editor of your choice)

## 🔧 Installation

### Step 1: Install Go

1. Visit the official Go website: [https://go.dev/]
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system
3. Follow the installation instructions for your platform

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:
```
go version go1.24.5 windows/amd64
```

### Step 3: Set GOPATH (Optional)

Modern Go development uses Go modules, so setting GOPATH is typically not necessary. However, if needed for your specific setup, you can set it according to your operating system's instructions.

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Creating Your First Go Program

1. **Create a new file** called `hello.go`

2. **Add the following code:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World! Welcome to my Go journey")
}
```

3. **Run the program:**

```bash
go run hello.go
```

4. **Expected output:**
```
Hello, World! Welcome to my Go journey
```
